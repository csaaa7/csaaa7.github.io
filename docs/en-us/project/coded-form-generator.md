 The core service of Bluetooth Smart Pen technology is to provide form encoding functionality.

- Redesigned the processing workflow based on the SDK provided by the Bluetooth Smart Pen technology partner, successfully overcoming previous issues of insufficient form resources and inability to reuse forms, saving the company approximately $7,000 USD per year.

- Developed an automated form encoding deployment tool that can preload encoded forms in specified formats and ranges for transfer to customer environments, speeding up form generation and resolving issues related to the use in restricted network environments.
