> <h4> Gas Cylinder Electronic Lock System </h4>

By integrating with the FMCS (Facility Monitoring & Control System) and using an app to pair with the barcode on the gas cylinder, the electronic lock can be locked and unlocked, preventing operational errors by personnel.

- Responsible for writing the data synchronization program on the Windows platform:
1. Synchronize with the FMCS:
Regularly retrieve gas cylinder content information from the monitoring system and update it to the backend.

2. Synchronize the mobile database:
The program was developed because mobile devices cannot access the backend via network for security reasons. It retrieves data and updates the database on the mobile device via MTP (Media Transfer Protocol).
